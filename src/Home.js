          ðŸ‘‹ Hi, my name is Emily. I am an ambitious and motivated software
          engineer with communication, leadership, and problem-solving skills
          developed through my years of teaching and my Fulbright grant. I am
          detail-oriented, creative, and a team player. My international
          experiences and drive to be challenged make me a distinguished
          candidate.

          In my free time, I like to travel, hike, ski, read, and spend time
          with family and friends.
